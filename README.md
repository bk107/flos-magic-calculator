# Flos Magic Calculator
This was a fun little project I did for my older brother, called "Flo". He needed a tool for specific calculations at work. In the end, it could have been an excel, but this app also includes switching between a dark and a light theme, and conditional rendering to show only needed tabs that the user can control.

## how to start
1. clone repo
2. open bash/cmd in dir
3. run npm install
4. start app with yarn start

(the app is german only, source code is mixed and I admit that is not good.)
